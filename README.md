# Simple Recorder.js demo
A simple HTML5/JS demo that uses [Recorder.js](https://github.com/mattdiamond/Recorderjs) to record audio as wav and pause/resume the recording process. 

Update: I've added the ability to upload/POST the file using a plain `XMLHttpRequest`. I've seen many demos using `$.ajax()` but you need jQuery for that.

The demo works on both mobile - including Safari 11 - and desktop browsers. I've taken great care to make the demo easy to use on both screens types.
